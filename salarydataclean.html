                <li>Small cleanup decisions can significantly affect downstream insights.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- EDA-->
            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <p>With the cleaned dataset, various analyses can be performed.</p>

            <p>From the <strong>df.describe(include='all')</strong> we found out that:
            </br>
            </br>
            The cleaned dataset that was handled properly contains <strong>28,183</strong> salary survey responses, 
            covering a wide range of job titles, industries, countries, and experience levels.
            </p>

            <p> It shows a high diversity of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1,184 industries</li>
                <li>12,169 job titles</li>
                <li>105 countries</li>
                <li>3,491 cities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With most common profile:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>25 to 34 years old, works in Technology as a Software Engineer, based in the US, paid in USD.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>About the <strong>free-text</strong> and <strong>high salary ranges</strong> we kept those informations as it was, 
                because even the salary outliers sometimes can provide useful insights about high-paying roles or industries.

            <h3><strong>Distributions Over Time</strong></h3>

            <!-- Container for side-by-side images -->
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s1.png" alt="Project 1" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s2.png" alt="Project 2" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s3.png" alt="Project 3" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s4.png" alt="Project 4" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>

            <p> We can comprehend in the distribution over time that the Salary Survey dataset contains information from year 2021 to 2025. According
                to the year counts there is a significant fluctuation in the number of records each year, with 2021 having the highest count of entries over all months,
                while for other years the counts are relatively lower, with a small increase in 2025.
            </br>
            </br> It is also important to mention that all the time distributions illustrate a seasonal pattern, with highest peaks across all years occuring
            around April. All these insights can help us understand the data collection trends and potential crisis in the industries during these years (e.g. Covid-19).
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Age Distribution</strong></h3>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s7.png" alt="Age Distribution" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            <p> The age distribution plot shows that the majority of respondents fall within the 25-34 age range, followed by the 35-44 range.
                This indicates that the dataset primarily represents early to mid-career professionals. There are fewer respondents in the younger (18 and under, 18-24) and older (55+) age brackets,
                suggesting that these groups are either less represented in the survey or less likely to participate.</p>

            <h3><strong>Job Titles & Industries</strong></h3>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s8.png" alt="Top Job Titles" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s9.png" alt="Top Industries" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            <p> The top job titles and industries plots reveal the most common roles and sectors represented in the dataset.
                Software Engineer, Technology fields, and Manager are among the most frequently reported job titles, indicating a strong presence of tech and managerial roles.
                In terms of industries, Technology, Finance, and Healthcare dominate the dataset, reflecting key sectors where salary data is being collected.
                This information can help identify trends and disparities in compensation across different roles and industries. Additionally, this high increase 
                and need in the technology sector can be linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, where digital transformation accelerated rapidly.    
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Country Distribution</strong></h3>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s10.png" alt="Country Distribution" style="width: 500px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            <p> The country distribution plot highlights the geographical representation of respondents in the dataset.
                The United States has the highest number of entries, indicating a strong focus on salary data from this region.
                Other countries with significant representation include the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
                This distribution suggests that the dataset may be skewed towards English-speaking countries or since they are more dominant countries in the job market. 
                Understanding the country distribution is crucial for interpreting salary trends and making region-specific analyses.</p>

            <h3><strong>Salary Distribution</strong></h3>
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="images/Salary_Survey_Cleaning/salary_s11.png" alt="Salary Distribution" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
            </div>
            <p> The salary distribution plot shows a right-skewed distribution, with most salaries concentrated at the lower end of the scale.
                A significant number of respondents report salaries below $100,000, while there are fewer entries in the higher salary ranges.
                This indicates that while there are high earners in the dataset, the majority of respondents fall within moderate salary brackets.
                The presence of outliers with very high salaries suggests variability in compensation across different roles and industries.
                This distribution is typical for salary data, where a small percentage of individuals earn significantly more than the average. 
            </br>
            </br>
            The salary distribution contains outliers in purpose, as they can provide useful insights about high-paying roles or industries. However,
            for certain analyses, it may be beneficial to focus on the central portion of the distribution to avoid skewing results. It will be better to 
            normalize or log-transform the salary data for more accurate statistical analysis, before providing important insights.

            </br>
            </br>
            This part could be handled very different but for the purpose of this project we kept the outliers as they were.
            </p>

            <!-- Results / Conclusion -->
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 0.8em; margin-bottom: 1.4rem;">This project highlights practical, real-world data cleaning 
                skills and prepares the foundation for deeper salary analytics. Transforming messy data into a structured, trustworthy 
                dataset enables meaningful insights that can drive decision-making in HR, compensation benchmarking, and workforce strategy.
